The new build process for unix style machines was done in Apr-2001 it 
incorperates a boot build to enable the system to be build without 
already having Firebird already installed.

At this stage the README.<platorm> documents are the latest and the others
have been left currently in case some details have been missed.  They will
eventually be removed.
