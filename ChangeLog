2001-12-16 09:19  robocop

	* interbase/burp/: backup.e, burp.h, restore.e:
	
	Make gbak more consistent in handling string lengths and sizes.

2001-12-15 14:46  skywalker

	* interbase/builds/original/: boot.sfx.interbase, sfx.interbase:
	
	Change linux classic packages to point to new updated routine

	* interbase/FB_Build_Win32_Build_No.bat:
	
	Win32 interbase

2001-12-09 21:12  nmcc

	* interbase/dsql/pass1.c:
	
	Further changes to allow select items with agg functions inside
	udfs but stop invalid references to other fields within the item.

2001-12-09 21:07  nmcc

	* interbase/dsql/dsql.c:
	
	Change DSQL_pretty (debugging proc) to cope with different types of
	nod_udf.

2001-12-07 12:57  paul_reeves

	* interbase/FB_Build_Win32_Build_No.bat:
	
	Removed superfluous quotes from fb_build_suffix for the Win32
	build.

2001-12-07 09:30  robocop

	* interbase/dsql/: ddl.c, ddl_proto.h, metd.e, metd_proto.h:
	
	Close the bug where a previously 2-bpc or 3-bpc charset-based field
	needed the full specification again to change only its length.
	Since DYN doesn't acknowledge changes in charset or collation, why
	worry? Just have DSQL calculate the correct field length based on
	the previous field definition's charset and the new charlen. Both
	new charset and new collation are ignored by DYN for now.  NOTE:
	bpc = bytes per character.  Ex: f1 char(3) character set
	unicode_fss alter column f1 type char(5) => previously failed
	trying to set length to 5, now sets length to 3*5=15 alter column
	f1 type char(7) => previously worked but screwed the field's length
	using one bpc: 7 is not multiple of 3. Now it calculates 7*3=21.

2001-12-06 15:18  paul_reeves

	* interbase/: FB_Build_Win32_Build_No.bat,
	builds_win32/original/build_no.ksh:
	
	Updated scripts that generate build_no.h to reflect impending RC2

2001-12-04 16:31  paul_reeves

	* interbase/: FB_Build_Win32.bat, FB_Build_Win32_Build_No.bat,
	FB_Build_Win32_Readme.txt:
	
	Win32 build - Turned off compile warnings by default and added
	option to turn them on. Fixed slash conversion to work correctly.
	Added string terminator to special build resource in version_95.rc.

2001-12-04 08:19  robocop

	* interbase/dsql/: ddl.c, dsql.h, metd.e, metd_proto.h, pass1.c:
	
	Allow UDF arguments to be query parameters. Beware that with udfs
	that use descriptors, the formal argument is used; the engine
	cannot guess the actual intended argument type: a UDF using int by
	descritor can cope with any numeric type with precision smaller
	than 10 but the client will see an integer parameter. This issue
	doesn't happen with arguments that aren't parameters, so one way is
	to redeclare the udf for the exact needed type and the other is to
	try to change the DSQL descriptors, same as when varchar can be
	changed to char in the API examples.

2001-12-04 01:00  awharrison

	* interbase/dsql/pass1.c:
	
	
	Check that a field exists before checking its ambiguity

2001-12-03 15:13  paul_reeves

	* interbase/builds_win32/original/: include.mak, std.mk:
	
	Removed references to DELPHI define in the Win32 make files.
	Delphi6 encourages the setting of a DELPHI env var which rather
	confuses the current build process.

2001-11-30 09:08  robocop

	* interbase/dsql/pass1.c:
	
	And here comes the rebellious sonny, breaks into the silence of the
	night and restores his check for field ambiguities, killing the
	newborn fatal bugs (that would trash or crash the engine) to be
	able to regain the glory of the updated code.

2001-11-29 12:16  paul_reeves

	* interbase/: FB_Build_Win32.bat, FB_Build_Win32_Build_DBs.bat,
	FB_Build_Win32_Build_No.bat, FB_Build_Win32_Readme.txt,
	builds_win32/original/build_no.ksh:
	
	Moved isc_major_ver define to build_no.h. Updated platform build_no
	scripts and Win32 versioning. Improved Win32 build process to
	detect changed messages database.

2001-11-27 19:50  awharrison

	* interbase/dsql/: ddl.c, dsql.h, errd.c, pass1.c:
	
	
	
	 Modified Files:
		interbase/dsql/ddl.c interbase/dsql/dsql.h
		interbase/dsql/errd.c interbase/dsql/pass1.c
	
	   1)  removed ambiguity checking to a subroutine
	   2)  eliminated the requirement that each routine
	       calling pass1_field keep a counter, since
	       pass1_field always reset the counter.
	   3)  eliminated the counter and the arrays that
	       held potential matches for the field in
	       favor of a list of relations and a list of
	       procedures.
	
	In the process, realized that ERRD_post_warning does nothing to
	preserve string arguments that might be stack local.  Warnings are
	collected until the statement is ready to execute, so stack
	variables tend to be unavailable.  Caused ERRD_post_warning to call
	ERR_cstring to put those values in the jrd error ring buffer.  This
	is cross component, and causes a warning that ERR_cstring is not
	defined.  Inclding err_proto.h introduces lots of errors because
	JRD and DSQL use the same names for different structures.   FB2
	should unify the error handling of DSQL and JRD.  Since
	ERRD_post_waring and ERRD_post both copy strings, removed
	references to ERR_cstring elsewhere.
	-------------------------------------------------------------------
	--- Fixed the abiguity checking to distinguish between sql dialects
	so it returns a warning in dialect 1 and an error in dialect 3.  In
	the process, decided that the string "table/view" was ugly and that
	it should know whether the entity was a table or view.	In the
	process, decided that the whole process was too complex and
	simplified it in the following ways:

2001-11-22 09:16  robocop

	* interbase/dsql/pass1.c:
	
	Do not check for ambiguity when the field or procedure parameter
	comes fully qualified.

2001-11-22 08:52  robocop

	* interbase/dsql/make.c:
	
	Fixes SF bug #484399. UDFs now can return NULL to the DSQL layer.

2001-11-21 20:25  awharrison

	* interbase/dsql/utld.c:
	
	
	Because parse_sqlda decides that a prepared statement has already
	been executed and returns a 0 in the blr_length field, code in
	interface.c neglects to check that the statement is also the most
	recently executed statement, leading to confusion about SQLDA's on
	the server side.  Turned off the optimization as a stop-gap.  We'll
	need to beef up the statement identification in the next release.

2001-11-21 03:50  robocop

	* interbase/burp/backup.e:
	
	Allow generators with embedded blanks in names to save their values
	to the backup file.  Clean a bit the mess in the code that removes
	trailing spaces.

2001-11-18 22:27  nmcc

	and super server builds work again. Display bit io size selected.

2001-11-18 16:35  nmcc

	* interbase/Configure.sh:
	
	Change new 64bit IO question to honour NOPROMPT_SETUP - defaults to

2001-11-18 06:16  bellardo

	* interbase/Configure.sh:
	
	The Configure.sh script now asks about a 64 bit io build on *nix
	platforms where 64 bit io is applicable.  Writes out the correct
	macro definition to jrd/64bitio.h if the user wants a 64 bit io
	build.

2001-11-07 03:49  nmcc

2001-11-02 16:08  awharrison

	* interbase/burp/backup.e:
	
	
	The simple fix didn't work because it tried to redefine
	RDB$SECURITY_CLASSES.  I could have make a corresponding change in
	restore, but at that point this was too complicated and it's time
	to look for a better answer.

2001-11-02 15:50  awharrison

	got the name of the generator wrong.

2001-10-31 18:09  awharrison

	* interbase/burp/backup.e:
	
	
	Backup the system generator rdb$security_class to avoid reusing

	* interbase/dsql/: alld.c, dsql.c, errd.c, gen.c:
	
	
	Beefed up the BUGCHECK handling in DSQL which sometimes returned
	success when it meant failure.	Also check in dsql8_prepare to fail
	when passed an inadequate request handle.

2001-10-29 08:29  robocop

	* interbase/dsql/alld.c:
	
	ALLD_alloc was calling ERRD_bugcheck() when it doesn't have to call
	it due to a bad implicit cast. No call to
	isc_dsql_allocate_statement would succeed due to this small issue.

2001-10-29 01:52  nmcc

	In alld.c, changed references to blk_pool_id to blk_pool_id_mod and
	changed some asserts to bugchecks.  The change to blk_pool_id
	exists passim.	In make, removed the unused and buggy MAKE_numeric.
	 parse.c and parse.y got touched as I removed the exec_sql code

	Fixed the union view problem I introduced without breaking the
	context checking that Claudio did.  Also added some code to handle
	a nod_variable - was just returning an uninitialized variable. 
	also changed <struct> -> <element> to <struct>-><element>.  I like
	spaces more than most but not there.

	* interbase/dsql/: ddl.c, dsql.h, pass1.c, utld.c:
	
	
	Changed the way union contexts were passed to ddl.c to avoid
	confusing the code that recognizes ambiguous context names

2001-10-11 06:43  robocop

	* interbase/dsql/: ddl.c, dsql.c, parse.c, parse.y, pass1.c:
	
	1) Bug fix for #444463 entailed the creation of new system flags
	for triggers that are defined automagically for CHECKs, FKs
	(cascade, set null, set default) and VIEWs using WITH CHECK OPTION.
	We can't rely on those flags for current databases, but the engine
	is already generating them in new triggers for those cases.  2) The
	engine recognizes and honors GRANT something to ROLE role_name; and
	will give an error if "role_name" doesn't exist instead of assuming
	that role_name is a user. Using GRANT something to USER user_name;
	will always grant to a user, even if a role named "user_name"
	already exists. If you want the old behavior (engine first tests if
	the given grantee exists as a role; otherwise grants to a user)
	simply omit USER or ROLE keywords and you are done. Isql will now
	extract with those explicit keywords so the script doesn't change
	meaning from machine to machine, depending on isc4.gdb's entries. 
	3) Neil McCalden has fixed a problem with UDFs and GROUP BY clause.
	 The problem was excess of flexibility that allowed invalid
	grouping. Now, the same rules apply to UDFs and fields regarding
	entries in the SELECT part v/s entries in the GROUP BY part. You
	will get the same "invalid column reference" error when attempting
	invalid usage of UDFs in a SELECT statement. Example: select
	strlen(rdb$relation_id) from rdb$relations group by
	strlen(rdb$relation_name); => invalid column reference.

	Changed to reduce shift/reduce conflicts

2001-08-04 21:27  bellardo

	* interbase/dsql/: parse.c, parse.y:
	
	Changed FIRST/SKIP syntax to:
	
	SELECT [FIRST X | FIRST ? | FIRST (value)] [SKIP X | SKIP ? | SKIP
	(value)] ...  where X is a long integer ONLY.  The syntax still
	accepts full value expressions, but it requires the parens around
	them.
	
	because with the old syntax and the following query:
	
	SELECT FIRST 5 * FROM MESSAGES;
	
	the parser was treating the * as the times symbol and not the field
	list.  This caused an error because '5 * FROM' doesn't parse.

	* interbase/dsql/: ddl.c, dsql.c, dsql.h, make.c, make_proto.h,
	parse.c, parse.y, parse_proto.h:
	
	Background: When a column has a default value, or it's domain has a
	default value, and that column is defined for a specific character
	set, then GBAK can abort with a transliteration error.	The default
	value is stored in BLR in the system tables and the generated BLR
	indicates that value was created with the character set DYNAMIC. 
	Consider the following ISQL statements:
	
	set names win1251; create database "cf.gdb"; create table
	bug_bugbase (	  s varchar(20) character set win1251	       
	default 'RôbértNélsôn' not null collate win1251,     i smallint
	default '1234' not null);
	
	The generated BLR is:
	
	blr_version5, blr_literal, blr_text2, 127,0, 12,0,
	'R',-12,'b',-23,'r','t','N',-23,'l','s',-12,'n', blr_eoc
	
	where the 127 represents the DYNAMIC character set.  When DYNAMIC
	is encountered it is reassigned to the current character set, in
	the case of GBAK that character set is NONE, and then the value is
	transliterated into the character set of the column.  If there are
	non-English characters involved then it can not be transliterated
	from character set NONE to any other character set.  Consider this
	ISQL code:
	
	set names win1251; connect "cf.gdb"; insert into bug_bugbase (s)
	values('BruceNélsôn');
	
	When the insert is Prepared, the following steps are preformed:
	
	1) Fetch the default value from the meta data 2) Since it has a
	character set of DYNAMIC (the 127), re-assign it to the current
	character set (SET NAMES WIN1251 of the current ISQL session).	3)
	Copy it into the holding area, and transliterate the field into the
	correct character set.	Since it's been reassigned to win1251 and
	since the holding area is win1251 a simple data copy is performed.
	
	And everything is happy.
	
	Now consider GBAK.  GBAK does not include any opportunity to enter
	a SET NAMES command, and since there can be default values in
	different character sets a SET NAMES command would not help.  GBAK
	operates using the character set NONE.	When GBAK Prepares the
	insert statement to load the data from the backup file into the
	restored database the following happens:
	
	1) Fetch the default value from the meta data 2) Since it has a
	character set of DYNAMIC (the 127), re-assign it to the current
	character set NONE.  3) Copy it into the holding area, and
	transliterate the field into the correct character set.  Since it's
	been reassigned to the character set NONE and since the holding
	area is win1251 then an attempt is made to transliterate the
	default from NONE to WIN1251.  Under the covers a valiant effort is
	made to first transliterate it into UNICODE, but the first
	non-english character brings that to an abrupt halt.
	
	This patch is written to change how the default value is stored so
	that it has the correct character set identifier, either the
	character set specified when the connection was made to the
	database, or ,if it exists, the character set specified with a
	character set introducer.  From the example above, the new BLR
	becomes: blr_version5, blr_literal, blr_text2, 52,0, 12,0,
	'R',-12,'b',-23,'r','t','N',-23,'l','s',-12,'n', blr_eoc
	
	(52 represent the WIN1251 character set.) Design: I've considered
	the following three components to be separate: 1.     Engine 2.    
	  DSQL 3. Parser
	
	The significance of this is separation is in the methods available
	to communicate information across the different components.
	
	The Engine knows the attachment character set, so to communicate
	that value I've added a tag to the INF_database_info routine to
	report it.  I've modified DSQL to request this parameter and to
	pass it to the Parser when the string is passed.  I've modified the
	Parser to report this value to when creating a new String Constant.
	 I've created a new MAKE_str_constant routine to take the character
	set ID and use it when creating the string.  I've modified DSQL to
	properly process any character set identifiers.
	
	Important Considerations
	
	Because this change introduces a new tag in the INF_database_info
	routine, I have taken two precautions to prevent a conflict with
	other implementations of Interbase.  1) The tag name is  prefixed
	with FRB_ instead of GDS_ or ISC_.  2) The internal number is 101,
	not the next available number 65.
	
	Because this change is to the DSQL DDL component, and not to GBAK,
	existing databases are not directly affected or corrected by this
	change.  Values already converted to BLR are not modified in any
	way.
	
	Limitations Because this change only modifies how strings are
	stored it does not make reference to any db-wide character set
	definition.  Also, the character set identifier set with each
	string is controlled by either the attachment character set (SET
	NAMES) or the string character set specification (_WIN1251 'string
	value'). This can lead to some unexpected results.  Consider:
	create database "cf.gdb"; create table bug_bugbase (	 s
	varchar(20) character set win1251	    default 'Narf' not null
	collate win1251,     i smallint default '1234' not null);
	
	Also Consider:
	
	create database "cf.gdb" default character set win1251 ; create
	table bug_bugbase (	s varchar(20)		default 'Narf' not
	null,	  i smallint default '1234' not null);
	
	What character set is the default value?  My change would consider
	this default value to have been coded in the character set  NONE. 
	When referenced Interbase will attempt to transliterate the default
	value from NONE into WIN1251, and if that transliteration is not
	possible then an error will be reported.
	
	In addition, the character set name used is not stored in the
	Default Source field.  For proper documentation the value stored in
	the Default Source field should include the character set name, for
	example "default _WIN1252 'Point'", but I've not been able to
	develop the proper code to accomplish this.

2000-12-08 17:18  fsg

	* interbase/: setup_dirs, setup_dirs.ksh,
	builds_win32/original/build_no.ksh:
	
	Preliminary changes to get IB_BUILD_NO automatically increased on
	commits.
	
	setup_dirs will create 'jrd/build_no.h' by a call to a slightly
	modified 'builds_win32/original/build_no.ksh' that gets IB_BUILD_NO
	from 'this_build', that hopefully will be increased automatically
	in the near future :-)
	
	I have changed 'jrd/iblicense.h' to use IB_BUILD_TYPE from
	'jrd/build_no.h'.  So all changes to version numbers, build types
	etc. can now be done in 'builds_win32/original/build_no.ksh'.

2000-10-17 07:43  patrickgriffin

	* interbase/dsql/gen.c:
	
	The build in functions AVG(x) and SUM(x) when used on integer
	fields can produce result columns with no title.
	
	For example:
	
	SQL> show table p; PNO				   VARCHAR(6)
	Nullable PNAME				 VARCHAR(20) Nullable COLOR
				  VARCHAR(6) Nullable WEIGHT		   
		  INTEGER Nullable CITY 			  
	VARCHAR(15) Nullable SQL> select avg(weight) from p;
	
	=====================
	
			   15
	
	SQL>
	
	The coding for the titles of these two fields was conditionally
	compiled according to the EXACT_NUMERIC definition, which was never
	set.  The #ifdef has been removed so that this coding is always
	compiled.
	
	(A very similar EXACT_NUMERICS is defined for HP10 and solaris
	builds, but this coding seems to be independent of this problem.)

	* interbase/dsql/dsql.c:
	
	10/13/2000 Fix for bug #113708.
	
	COBOL programs, as well as some other non-c languages, do not use
	null terminated strings and will encounter random -502 CURSOR
	ALREADY DEFINED messages.
	
	With the introduction of dialect 3, the cursor name parsing routine
	was modified to accept cursor names that include spaces.  COBOL
	programs, using dialect 1, which pass a space-terminated cursor
	name may have adjacent binary data included as a part of the cursor
	name.
	
	This fix changes the parse routine for dialect 1 processing to stop
	on either the first space or the first null character.

	- Use -O instead of -O3 for production build (-O3 is asking for
