	* interbase/: jrd/common.h, jrd/unix.c, utilities/analyse.c,
	utilities/dba.e, utilities/dba_full.e, utilities/rebuild.c,
	utilities/sbc_print.c:
	
	Added 64 bit io code for *nix.	Requires the macro UNIX_64_BIT_IO
	to be defined, or else you get a 32 bit version.  Since all
	supported Darwin platforms support 64 bit it the macro is always
	defined on Darwin.  No other platforms have the macro defined by
	default.  unix.c now performs a runtime check on the 32 bit builds
	to make sure they don't exceed a 2 GB file size.  Note that this
	doesn't effect the PREAD_WRITE code.  Platforms that use
	PREAD_WRITE are can't use the 64 bit io stuff.	Looking through the
	platform files and common.h revealed not platforms use PREAD_WRITE.
	 So this limitation is not a problem.

	* interbase/dsql/alld.c:
	
	ALLD_alloc was calling ERRD_bugcheck() when it doesn't have to call
	it due to a bad implicit cast. No call to
	isc_dsql_allocate_statement would succeed due to this small issue.

2001-10-29 01:52  nmcc

	* interbase/isql/isql.e:
	
	
	Turns out that procedures are honorary select statements ... fixed.
	 Also moved a statement type check before the debugging stuff that
	uses it.

	* interbase/dsql/: alld.c, dsql.c, dsql.h, dsql_proto.h, gen.c,
	make.c, make_proto.h, node.h, parse.c, parse.y:
	
	
	In alld.c, changed references to blk_pool_id to blk_pool_id_mod and
	changed some asserts to bugchecks.  The change to blk_pool_id
	exists passim.	In make, removed the unused and buggy MAKE_numeric.
	 parse.c and parse.y got touched as I removed the exec_sql code
	from them.

2001-10-25 21:35  awharrison

	* interbase/jrd/sdw.c:
	
	
	Move the check for the existence of shadow files to the beginning

2001-10-23 23:23  awharrison

	* interbase/dsql/pass1.c:
	
	
	Fixed the union view problem I introduced without breaking the
	context checking that Claudio did.  Also added some code to handle
	a nod_variable - was just returning an uninitialized variable. 
	also changed <struct> -> <element> to <struct>-><element>.  I like
	spaces more than most but not there.

	make gds_alloc_flag_unfreed a bit less sensitive to zero length
	blocks.

2001-10-22 23:46  awharrison

	* interbase/isql/isql.e:
	
	
	Fixed two problems that caused errors when a select statement has
	no return values.  The case shouldn't come up, but the errors were
	egrigious.  In one case the statement type was being set by the
	number of parameters immediately after getting the statement type
	from an info call.  In the other, a debugging routine called
	gds_alloc_unfreed with a zero length block.

2001-10-19 22:08  awharrison

2001-10-11 06:43  robocop

	* interbase/dsql/: ddl.c, dsql.c, parse.c, parse.y, pass1.c:
	
	1) Bug fix for #444463 entailed the creation of new system flags
	for triggers that are defined automagically for CHECKs, FKs
	(cascade, set null, set default) and VIEWs using WITH CHECK OPTION.
	We can't rely on those flags for current databases, but the engine
	is already generating them in new triggers for those cases.  2) The
	engine recognizes and honors GRANT something to ROLE role_name; and
	will give an error if "role_name" doesn't exist instead of assuming
	that role_name is a user. Using GRANT something to USER user_name;
	will always grant to a user, even if a role named "user_name"
	already exists. If you want the old behavior (engine first tests if
	the given grantee exists as a role; otherwise grants to a user)
	simply omit USER or ROLE keywords and you are done. Isql will now
	extract with those explicit keywords so the script doesn't change
	meaning from machine to machine, depending on isc4.gdb's entries. 
	3) Neil McCalden has fixed a problem with UDFs and GROUP BY clause.
	 The problem was excess of flexibility that allowed invalid
	grouping. Now, the same rules apply to UDFs and fields regarding
	entries in the SELECT part v/s entries in the GROUP BY part. You
	will get the same "invalid column reference" error when attempting
	invalid usage of UDFs in a SELECT statement. Example: select
	strlen(rdb$relation_id) from rdb$relations group by
	strlen(rdb$relation_name); => invalid column reference.

	met.e, met_proto.h, par.c, scl.e, scl.h:
	
	Fixes SF bug #458888 and SF bug #444463 The latter also entailed
	the creation of new system flags for triggers that are defined
	automagically for CHECKs, FKs (cascade, set null, set default) and
	VIEWs using WITH CHECK OPTION. We can't rely on those flags for
	current databases, but the engine is already generating them in new
	triggers for those cases. The engine now checks security_classes to
	distinguish fields reliably at the time a call to CMP_post_access()
	should be made from post_trigger_access().

2001-08-05 13:46  skywalker

	* interbase/dsql/parse.y:
	
	Changed to reduce shift/reduce conflicts

2001-08-04 21:27  bellardo

	* interbase/dsql/: parse.c, parse.y:
	
	Changed FIRST/SKIP syntax to:
	
	SELECT [FIRST X | FIRST ? | FIRST (value)] [SKIP X | SKIP ? | SKIP
	(value)] ...  where X is a long integer ONLY.  The syntax still
	accepts full value expressions, but it requires the parens around
	them.
	
	because with the old syntax and the following query:
	
	SELECT FIRST 5 * FROM MESSAGES;
	
	the parser was treating the * as the times symbol and not the field
	list.  This caused an error because '5 * FROM' doesn't parse.

	jrd/ibase.h, jrd/inf.c:
	
	Background: When a column has a default value, or it's domain has a
	default value, and that column is defined for a specific character
	set, then GBAK can abort with a transliteration error.	The default
	value is stored in BLR in the system tables and the generated BLR
	indicates that value was created with the character set DYNAMIC. 
	Consider the following ISQL statements:
	
	set names win1251; create database "cf.gdb"; create table
	bug_bugbase (	  s varchar(20) character set win1251	       
	default 'RbrtNlsn' not null collate win1251,     i smallint
	default '1234' not null);
	
	The generated BLR is:
	
	blr_version5, blr_literal, blr_text2, 127,0, 12,0,
	'R',-12,'b',-23,'r','t','N',-23,'l','s',-12,'n', blr_eoc
	
	where the 127 represents the DYNAMIC character set.  When DYNAMIC
	is encountered it is reassigned to the current character set, in
	the case of GBAK that character set is NONE, and then the value is
	transliterated into the character set of the column.  If there are
	non-English characters involved then it can not be transliterated
	from character set NONE to any other character set.  Consider this
	ISQL code:
	
	set names win1251; connect "cf.gdb"; insert into bug_bugbase (s)
	values('BruceNlsn');
	
	When the insert is Prepared, the following steps are preformed:
	
	1) Fetch the default value from the meta data 2) Since it has a
	character set of DYNAMIC (the 127), re-assign it to the current
	character set (SET NAMES WIN1251 of the current ISQL session).	3)
	Copy it into the holding area, and transliterate the field into the
	correct character set.	Since it's been reassigned to win1251 and
	since the holding area is win1251 a simple data copy is performed.
	
	And everything is happy.
	
	Now consider GBAK.  GBAK does not include any opportunity to enter
	a SET NAMES command, and since there can be default values in
	different character sets a SET NAMES command would not help.  GBAK
	operates using the character set NONE.	When GBAK Prepares the
	insert statement to load the data from the backup file into the
	restored database the following happens:
	
	1) Fetch the default value from the meta data 2) Since it has a
	character set of DYNAMIC (the 127), re-assign it to the current
	character set NONE.  3) Copy it into the holding area, and
	transliterate the field into the correct character set.  Since it's
	been reassigned to the character set NONE and since the holding
	area is win1251 then an attempt is made to transliterate the
	default from NONE to WIN1251.  Under the covers a valiant effort is
	made to first transliterate it into UNICODE, but the first
	non-english character brings that to an abrupt halt.
	
	This patch is written to change how the default value is stored so
	that it has the correct character set identifier, either the
	character set specified when the connection was made to the
	database, or ,if it exists, the character set specified with a
	character set introducer.  From the example above, the new BLR
	becomes: blr_version5, blr_literal, blr_text2, 52,0, 12,0,
	'R',-12,'b',-23,'r','t','N',-23,'l','s',-12,'n', blr_eoc
	
	(52 represent the WIN1251 character set.) Design: I've considered
	the following three components to be separate: 1.     Engine 2.    
	  DSQL 3. Parser
	
	The significance of this is separation is in the methods available
	to communicate information across the different components.
	
	The Engine knows the attachment character set, so to communicate
	that value I've added a tag to the INF_database_info routine to
	report it.  I've modified DSQL to request this parameter and to
	pass it to the Parser when the string is passed.  I've modified the
	Parser to report this value to when creating a new String Constant.
	 I've created a new MAKE_str_constant routine to take the character
	set ID and use it when creating the string.  I've modified DSQL to
	properly process any character set identifiers.
	
	Important Considerations
	
	Because this change introduces a new tag in the INF_database_info
	routine, I have taken two precautions to prevent a conflict with
	other implementations of Interbase.  1) The tag name is  prefixed
	with FRB_ instead of GDS_ or ISC_.  2) The internal number is 101,
	not the next available number 65.
	
	Because this change is to the DSQL DDL component, and not to GBAK,
	existing databases are not directly affected or corrected by this
	change.  Values already converted to BLR are not modified in any
	way.
	
	Limitations Because this change only modifies how strings are
	stored it does not make reference to any db-wide character set
	definition.  Also, the character set identifier set with each
	string is controlled by either the attachment character set (SET
	NAMES) or the string character set specification (_WIN1251 'string
	value'). This can lead to some unexpected results.  Consider:
	create database "cf.gdb"; create table bug_bugbase (	 s
	varchar(20) character set win1251	    default 'Narf' not null
	collate win1251,     i smallint default '1234' not null);
	
	Also Consider:
	
	create database "cf.gdb" default character set win1251 ; create
	table bug_bugbase (	s varchar(20)		default 'Narf' not
	null,	  i smallint default '1234' not null);
	
	What character set is the default value?  My change would consider
	this default value to have been coded in the character set  NONE. 
	When referenced Interbase will attempt to transliterate the default
	value from NONE into WIN1251, and if that transliteration is not
	possible then an error will be reported.
	
	In addition, the character set name used is not stored in the
	Default Source field.  For proper documentation the value stored in
	the Default Source field should include the character set name, for
	example "default _WIN1252 'Point'", but I've not been able to
	develop the proper code to accomplish this.

	* interbase/jrd/cmp.c:
	
	Please consider this contrived example:
	
	create table t0 (  a integer,  genid_field1 computed by
	(gen_id(gen1, 1)),  genid_field2 computed by (gen_id(gen2,
	genid_field1)),  genid_field3 computed by (gen_id(gen3,
	genid_field2));
	
	While I don't consider this to be an example of real-word SQL
	coding, it does show that the second argument of the gen_id
	function can be something other than a simple constant.
	
	As jrd/cmp.c is coded now this statement will get processed
	properly, but there is a serious problem:  The routine 'pass1' will
	attempt to parse the internal generator ID as if it was a pointer
	to an execution node.
	
	This change corrects 'pass1' processing to only pass the second
	argument on for further processing.

	* interbase/dsql/gen.c:
	
	The build in functions AVG(x) and SUM(x) when used on integer
	fields can produce result columns with no title.
	
	For example:
	
	SQL> show table p; PNO				   VARCHAR(6)
	Nullable PNAME				 VARCHAR(20) Nullable COLOR
				  VARCHAR(6) Nullable WEIGHT		   
		  INTEGER Nullable CITY 			  
	VARCHAR(15) Nullable SQL> select avg(weight) from p;
	
	=====================
	
			   15
	
	SQL>
	
	The coding for the titles of these two fields was conditionally
	compiled according to the EXACT_NUMERIC definition, which was never
	set.  The #ifdef has been removed so that this coding is always
	compiled.
	
	(A very similar EXACT_NUMERICS is defined for HP10 and solaris
	builds, but this coding seems to be independent of this problem.)

	* interbase/dsql/dsql.c:
	
	10/13/2000 Fix for bug #113708.
	
	COBOL programs, as well as some other non-c languages, do not use
	null terminated strings and will encounter random -502 CURSOR
	ALREADY DEFINED messages.
	
	With the introduction of dialect 3, the cursor name parsing routine
	was modified to accept cursor names that include spaces.  COBOL
	programs, using dialect 1, which pass a space-terminated cursor
	name may have adjacent binary data included as a part of the cursor
	name.
	
	This fix changes the parse routine for dialect 1 processing to stop
	on either the first space or the first null character.

	Modified Files: 	interbase/jrd/cmp.c
	
	10/13/2000
	
	Fix for bug #116579; Generators in computed by columns will return
	wrong results.
	
	If, in an ODS 10 or greater database, the gen_id function is
	included as a part of a computed field and another field references
	it or it is referenced in a select statement, the database will
	become corrupted.  This problem was introduced with the change to
	64 bit generator values.
	
	The COMPUTED BY clause is being parsed correctly, correct BLR is
	stored in the database, and this BLR is correctly converted into
	execution nodes by jrd/evl.c
	
	During jrd/cmp.c  'copy'  processing, called as a part of the pass1
	routine, this execution node is modified replacing the correct
	generator number with incorrect values.
	
	These changes fix that problem by causing the correct node-copying
	routine to be invoked.
