Introduction
============

Welcome to Firebird 1.0.0. This represents a feature complete
build of Firebird 1.0. It is the product of many months work by the 
Firebird team. See the Release Notes document for details of all the 
new features and the bug-fixes it contains. 


Intended Users
==============

Overall we believe this release to be more stable and more reliable than ANY 
previous release of Firebird or InterBase 6.n. It is the result of months of 
work and the release candidates have been tested by thousands of users. As 
such there is no reason to be overly concerned about using it in a production 
environment. However, before deploying ANY software into a production 
environment it should always be tested properly on a development system. 
This is standard practice.


Installing the self-installing executable
=========================================

Please run the executable and read the accompanying installation 
instructions that are contained within the setup wizard.


Known Issues
============

The following are the known issues at this time. (7-Mar-2002). 

  o Multi-file backup fails
