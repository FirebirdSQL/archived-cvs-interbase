QA_PROCS_ISQL:  Tests Stored Procedures using ISQL to create and execute.

                PROC_CAST4_ISQL, PROC_CAST6_ISQL will require LOCAL inits
		or they will fail due to the double precision variable.

History:
24-May-95:      clare.  Some failing remote due to the differences in
		output when double precision is used as an input param.
		and an error is forced.  Sent mail to engineering to see 
		if this was normal since it occurs in other tests.
