C_DSQL_RI_FIELD_ALT    Bug 8397 Test attempts to drop a table when there is
                                a constraint on it (a foreign index referencing
                                it).  Test assumes if you drop the column that
                                has the foreign index, you will be able to drop
                                the table.  In 4.5 you can no longer drop the
                                column without first dropping the index.  The
                                problem is, the user does not know that an index
                                got created when the constraint was set up.  The
                                constraint can be dropped, then the column, then
                                the table.  It would be better if IB recognized
                                that the index was foreign (created by IB on the
                                sly) and automatically deleted the index and
                                column.  Then this test would pass without
                                modification.  Bug #8397 was submitted with this
                                end in mind.  If not fixed, the workaround
                                should be documented, and the test altered to
                                drop the constraint before the column drop is
                                attempted.

                               In 4.0 we allowed columns to be deleted when
                                an index existed on the column.  We left the
                                index dangling.  This behavior was fixed
                                (Bug_no 8054) for 4.5 and caused the new
                                behavior to surface.  The old behavior was
                                causing problems on restore of the database
                                from a .gbk file.

                                After statement
                                    ALTER TABLE BOOKS DROP BOOK_AUTH_ID
                                Successful execution is expected, but behavior
                                has changed.  We no longer allow the column
                                BOOK_AUTH_ID to be dropped, it's referenced
                                in a foreign index.
