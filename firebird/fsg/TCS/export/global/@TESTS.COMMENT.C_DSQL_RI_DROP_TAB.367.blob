C_DSQL_RI_DROP_TAB    Bug 8397  (PENDING in build69.clare.) See series
				comments for RI_TESTS_ISQL for full comments)

  In 4.0 we allowed columns to be deleted when an index existed on the 
  column.  We left the index dangling.  This behavior was fixed (Bug 8054)
  for 4.5 and caused the new behavior to surface.  The old behavior was
  causing problems on restore of the database from a .gbk file.
