     -Linda Wahler
                                We try to drop field Author_ID when index
                                rdb$primary1 still exists on it.
                                Drop the index first,

                                SQL>drop index rdb$primary1;
                                Still failed, can't drop "an index used by an
                                Integrity Constraint".  It's not allowed.
                                alter table authors drop constraint AUTH_ID_KEY;

                                works.  I will add a comment to bug 8397 that
                                we should be sure the fix applies to constraints
                                that are internal to the table.

                                Line 199:  ALTER TABLE BOOKS DROP BOOK_AUTH_ID;
                                exhibits Bug 8397 also (discussed above).

                                Line 211:   ALTER TABLE AUTHORS DROP AUTHOR_ID;
                                exhibits Bug 8397 also (discussed above). Once
                                the fix is implemented for #8397, all three
                                errors should clear.
