RI_TESTS:
Around 20 V4.0 tests by M. Shulman, Allen Zhao, B. Sriram.

 Purpose: RI test suite
   History:
        This test is written to correct C_DSQL_RI_FIELD_DROP test.
        The C_DSQL_RI_FIELD_DROP test was doing lots of COMMIT RELEASE's
        which, in the case of a REMOTE test was detaching from the
        INET_SERVER. This resulted in 'inet_server' cache not being
        in sync.

          This test does the whole operation in only ONE transaction.
   25-Aug-97: clare: 4 tests failing due to no field name specified
	  when a foreign key is defined.  This used to be valid syntax.
	  Spec is showing changed syntax w/field required.  Checking w/
	  R+D before either changing tests or logging bug.

   Tests are:
        Table Constraints:
                unique          tab_uniq.e
                primary key     tab_prim.e
                referential     tab_ref.e
                check const     tab_check.e

        Column Constraints:
                unique          col_uniq.e
                primary key     col_prim.e
                referential     col_ref.e
                check const     col_check.e
                not null    col_nnull.e

        DDL Modify Operations:
                alter table add constraint      alt_add.e
                alter table drop constraint     alt_drop.e
                drop table                      drop_tab.e
                alter field                     field_alt.e
                drop field                      fieldrop.e
                alter index                     index_alt.e
                drop index                      index_drop.e
                delete trigger                  trigger_del.e
                modify trigger                  trigger_mod.e
