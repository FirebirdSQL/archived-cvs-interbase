Test re-initialized. DSQL_DOMAIN_13 
This test had a bad initialization due to a previously unknown bug
in ISQL.  The show command would ignore a local default if the domain
also had a default (the domain's default was always shown).  I accidently
fixed this bug when I rewrote the show command a few days ago.
