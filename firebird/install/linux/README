This directory and subdirectories contain the files required to package 
the Firebird binaries for linux.

To use you need to be in the root build directory interbase after having
done a build.

make -f firebird/install/linux/Makefile


will then give you instructions but basically:

make -f firebird/install/linux/Makefile classicpackages

will build both .tar.gz and .rpm packages for linux.
